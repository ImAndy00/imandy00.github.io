    <h2>Work Aspirations/Experience</h2>
    <p>I aspire to get a job in Software Engineering, Web Development, or Application Development whenever I graduate. I don't have a company I necessarily prefer to work for, and am more interested in working somewhere with an inclusive and inspiring work environment. This previous summer I gained experience in creating web applications while I was an Applications Development Intern for the company Nagarro. There I gained hands-on experience with JavaScript, CSS, API's, and React.</p>
